Minecraft Land Generator version 1.4.0

Originally by Corrodias
Tweaked by Morlok8k

This program lets you generate an area of land with your Minecraft Beta SMP server (and is prossibly future-proof for newer versions). You set up your java command line and minecraft server paths in the MinecraftLandGenerator.conf file, set up the server's server.properties file with the name of the world you wish to use, and then run this program.

When a Minecraft server is launched, it automatically generates chunks within a square area of 20x20 chunks (320x320 blocks), centered on the current spawn point. When provided X and Y ranges as arguments, this program will launch the server repeatedly, editing the level.dat file between sessions, to generate large amounts of land without players having to explore them. The generated land will have about the X and Y ranges as requested by the arguments, though it will not be exact due to the spawn point typically not on the border of a chunk. (Because of this, MLG by default adds a slight overlap with each pass - 300x300) You can use the -x and -y switches to override the spawn offset and center the land generation on a different point.

The program makes a backup of level.dat as level_backup.dat before editing, and restores the backup at the end. In the event that a level_backup.dat file already exists, the program will refuse to proceed, leaving the user to determine why the level_backup.dat file exists and whether they would rather restore it or delete it, which must be done manually.
